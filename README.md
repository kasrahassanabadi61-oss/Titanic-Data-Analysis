# Titanic Data Analysis Project

A complete data analysis project exploring the survival patterns of passengers aboard the Titanic using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to discover which factors influenced passenger survival during the disaster.  
The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical insights  
- A simple machine learning prediction model  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
1. **Women** were much more likely to survive than men.  
2. **First-class passengers** had the highest survival rate.  
3. **Younger passengers** (children and adolescents) had better survival chances.  
4. A simple Logistic Regression model achieved about **78% accuracy**.
